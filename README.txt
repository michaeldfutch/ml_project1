There are two jupyter notebooks, one for each problem. The first is for the classification problem and is called `Classification Problem.ipynb`. The data for this problem can be downloaded here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset. The charts and figures can all be found embedded in the notebook.

The second problem is a regression problem and is called `Regression Problem.ipynb`. The data for this problem can be downloaded here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction. Additionally, I ran all the addresses through the Google Maps API to extract latitude/longitude for each house. Again, all figures/charts can be found within the notebook.
